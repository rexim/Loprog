** DONE Implement variables' scope
   We can just add some unique prefix for every variable's name in a
   predicate's head and body. I think a hashcode of the predicate
   would be a nice prefix.

   *UPD* This solution sucks, 'cause it doesn't allow us to make
   recursive predicates. I think we should generate a unique varprefix
   each time we "invoke" (evaluate?) a predicate.

** TODO Implement REPL
*** TODO Think how to test the REPL
